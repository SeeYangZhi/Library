The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Each book you read not only teaches you something new but also opens up different ways of thinking about old ideas.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Mastery requires patience.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Many runners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line, they stop training. The race is no longer there to motivate them. When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it?</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don\u2019t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Habits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental unit that contributes to your overall improvement.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you\u2019ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Research has shown that once a person believes in a particular aspect of their identity, they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>When you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>If nothing changes, nothing is going to change.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>First, decide who you want to be. This holds at any level\u2014as an individual, as a team, as a community, as a nation. What do you want to stand for? What are your principles and values? Who do you wish to become?</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The process of habit formation begins with trial and error.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>In a sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Once a habit is firmly rooted in your life, it is mostly nonconscious and automatic</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>\u201CUntil you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.\u201D</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>\u201CDoes this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?\u201D</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The process of behavior change always starts with awareness.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>People who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Once an implementation intention has been set, you don\u2019t have to wait for inspiration to strike.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>When the moment of action occurs, there is no need to make a decision. Simply follow your predetermined plan.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>When your dreams are vague, it\u2019s easy to rationalize little exceptions all day long and never get around to the specific things you need to do to succeed.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>No behavior happens in isolation.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Habit stacking works best when the cue is highly specific and immediately actionable.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Many people select cues that are too vague.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The two most common cues are time and location.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>People often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Many of the actions we take each day are shaped not by purposeful drive and choice but by the most obvious option.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Every living being has its own methods for sensing and understanding the world.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>We perceive the world through sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Most powerful of all human sensory abilities, however, is vision.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The human body has about eleven million sensory receptors. Approximately ten million of those are dedicated to sight.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>you can imagine how important it is to live and work in environments that are filled with productive cues and devoid of unproductive ones.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>You don\u2019t have to be the victim of your environment. You can also be the architect of it.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Environment design is powerful not only because it influences how we engage with the world but also because we rarely do it. Most people live in a world others have created for them.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The power of context also reveals an important strategy: habits can be easier to change in a new environment.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>\u201COne space, one use.\u201D</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Whenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with another. When you start mixing contexts, you\u2019ll start mixing habits\u2014and the easier ones will usually win out.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>A stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is an environment where habits can easily form.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>I have never seen someone consistently stick to positive habits in a negative environment.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>A more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>\u201CIn the long history of humankind, those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.\u201D</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>We soak up the qualities and practices of those around us.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Habits seem achievable when you see others doing them every day.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe. It transforms a personal quest into a shared one.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Running against the grain of your culture requires extra effort.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>You transition from seeing these behaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>We can find evidence for whatever mind-set we choose.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>As Voltaire once wrote, \u201CThe best is the enemy of the good.\u201D</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The idea behind make it easy is not to only do easy things. The idea is to make it as easy as possible in the moment to do things that payoff in the long run.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Much of the battle of building better habits comes down to finding ways to reduce the friction associated with our good habits and increase the friction associated with our bad ones.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The habits you follow without thinking often determine the choices you make when you are thinking.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>A new habit should not feel like a challenge. The actions that follow can be challenging, but the first two minutes should be easy.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>You have to standardize before you can optimize.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>It\u2019s better to do less than you hoped than to do nothing at all.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Commitment devices are useful because they enable you to take advantage of good intentions before you can fall victim to temptation.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction until you don\u2019t even have the option to act.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>When you automate as much of your life as possible, you can spend your effort on the tasks machines cannot do yet.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The consequences of bad habits are delayed while the rewards are immediate.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>As a general rule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Behavior only shifts if the punishment is painful enough and reliably enforced.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Genes do not determine your destiny. They determine your areas of opportunity</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The key is to direct your effort toward areas that both excite you and match your natural skills, to align your ambition with your ability.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>A good player works hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A great player creates a new game that favors their strengths and avoids their weaknesses.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The fact that you have a natural limit to any specific ability has nothing to do with whether you are reaching the ceiling of your capabilities.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Until you work as hard as those you admire, don\u2019t explain away their success as luck.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Play a game that favors your strengths. If you can\u2019t find a game that favors you, create one.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Mastery requires practice. But the more you practice something, the more boring and routine it becomes.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Machiavelli noted, \u201CMen desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.\u201D</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Variable rewards or not, no habit will stay interesting forever. At some point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self-improvement: you have to fall in love with boredom.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>When a habit is truly important to you, you have to be willing to stick to it in any mood.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Habits are the backbone of any pursuit of excellence.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>It is precisely at the moment when you begin to feel like you have mastered a skill\u2014right when things are starting to feel automatic and you are becoming comfortable\u2014that you must avoid slipping into the trap of complacency.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Establish a system for reflection and review.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Life is constantly changing, so you need to periodically check in to see if your old habits and beliefs are still serving you.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Being motivated and curious counts for more than being smart because it leads to action. Being smart will never deliver results on its own because it doesn\u2019t get you to act. It is desire, not intelligence, that prompts behavior</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>\u201CBeing poor is not having too little, it is wanting more.\u201D</p></blockquote><hr>',226);function y(q,f){const t=a("ExternalLinkIcon");return i(),r(s,null,[u,b,p,e("p",null,[e("em",null,[e("a",d,[k,n(t)])])]),m],64)}var v=h(c,[["render",y]]);export{v as default};
