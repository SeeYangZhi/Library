## Summary

I would say that this book has many interesting dialogues between Kiyosaki, Robert T. and his Rich Dad, and it was interesting to read about their perception of what made the poor stay poor and how the rich get richer. I think that some of the ideas about the poor painted by the author could be quite controversial, for example, “Poor people are more greedy than rich people.” 

One takeaway from reading this book: I have become very curious about the history of tax and the financial system. 

Overall, it was fascinating to read about the anecdotes about his life and the lessons he learnt from his "Poor" and "Rich" Dads. And I thought that the main idea about this book is that, one has to learn about investing and be financially literate to not be restricted by the financial system created by the people of power.
