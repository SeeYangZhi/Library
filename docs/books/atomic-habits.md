## Summary

A book with actionable items and infortive ideas about creating good habits and eliminating bad habits for good. Highly recommended.

Some of the actions I have taken after reading the book:

1. Create a Habit Scorecard that includes the list of habits that I have. 
2. After creating the habit scorecard, create a specific implementation intention.
3. After getting used to the implementation intention, create a habit stacking.
4. Keep track of the habits and have an annual review of the list of habits. 

"Life is constantly changing, so you need to periodically check in to see if your old habits and beliefs are still serving you." - James Clear

---

---

> Mastery requires patience.

---

> Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.

> In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.

---

---

> Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.

---

> Habits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental unit that contributes to your overall improvement.

---

---

> If nothing changes, nothing is going to change.

---

> No behavior happens in isolation.

---

> Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior.
