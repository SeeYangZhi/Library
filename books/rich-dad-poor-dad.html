I think that some of the ideas about the poor painted by the author could be quite controversial, for example, “Poor people are more greedy than rich people.”</p><p>One takeaway from reading this book: I have become very curious about the history of tax and the financial system.</p><p>Overall, it was fascinating to read about the anecdotes about his life and the lessons he learnt from his &quot;Poor&quot; and &quot;Rich&quot; Dads. And I thought that the main idea about this book is that, one has to learn about investing and be financially literate to not be restricted by the financial system created by the people of power.</p><h2 id="quotes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#quotes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Quotes</h2><blockquote><p>Having two dads offered me the choice of contrasting points of view: one of a rich man and one of a poor man.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Instead of simply accepting or rejecting one or the other, I found myself thinking more, comparing, and then choosing for myself.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Having two dads whom I loved forced me to think and ultimately choose a way of thinking for myself.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>One of the reasons the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the middle class struggles in debt is that the subject of money is taught at home, not in school.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Out staggering national debt is due in large part to highly educated politicians and government officials making financial decisions with little or no training in the subject of money.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>He believed that automatically saying “I can’t afford it” was a sign of mental laziness.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The idea of job protection for life and job benefits seemed more important, at times, than the job.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Total financial self-reliance.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Strong business and financial plans</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The luxury of observing the effects different thoughts have on one’s life.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>People really do shape their lives through their thoughts.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>“A nice car and a nice house don’t necessarily mean you’re rich or you know how to make money,”</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>If you can’t make up your mind decisively, then you’ll never learn to make money anyway. Opportunities come and go.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>“Life pushes all of us around. Some people give up and others fight. A few learn the lesson and move on. They welcome life pushing them around. To these few people, it means they need and want to learn something. They learn and move on. Most quit, and a few like you fight.”</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>You will have lots of friend that like you because you were such a nice hardworking guy. But the truth is that you let life push you into submission.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Most will spend the best years of their lives working for money, not really understanding what it is they are working for.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The poor and the middle class work for money. The rich have money work for them.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>True learning takes energy, passion, and a burning desire. Anger is a big part of that formula, for passion is anger and love combined.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>It&#39;s fear that keeps most people working at a job: the fear of not paying their bills, the fear of being fired, the fear of not having enough money, and the fear of starting over. That’s the price of studying to learn a profession or trade, and then working for money—and then get angry at their boss.”.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>They want to go to school, learn a profession, have fun at their work, and earn lots of money. One day they wake up with big money problems, and then they can&#39;t stop working. That’s the price of only knowing how to work for money instead of studying how to have money work for you.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>They work very hard for little money, clinging to the illusion of job security and looking forward to a three-week vacation each year and maybe a skimpy pension after forty-five years of service.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>He understood that every person has a weak and needy part of their soul that can be bought, and he knew that every individual also had a part of their soul that was resilient and could never be bought.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>People’s lives are forever controlled by two emotions: fear and greed.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Most people have a price. And they have a price because of human emotions named fear and greed.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Not just to be rich, because being rich does not solve the problem.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Some call it greed, but I prefer desire.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>People also work for money because of desire.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>They desire money for the joy they think it can buy. But the joy that money brings is often short-lived, and they soon need more money for more joy, more pleasure, more comfort, and more security.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>“The avoidance of money is just as psychotic as being attached to money.”</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Be truthful about your emotions and use your mind and emotions in your favor, not against yourself.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Just be an observer, not a reactor, to your emotions.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Master the power of money, instead of being afraid of it. If you don’t learn it, you become a slave to money.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Avoid the trap caused by those two emotions, fear and desire. Use them in your favor, not against you.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>“The main cause of poverty or financial struggle is fear and ignorance, not the economy or the government or the rich.&quot;</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>It’s self-inflicted fear and ignorance that keep people trapped.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>We will always have emotions of fear and greed. From here on in, it&#39;s imperative for you to use those emotions to your advantage, and for the long term to not let your emotions control your thinking. Most people use fear and greed people against themselves. That&#39;s the start of ignorance. Most people live their lives chasing paychecks, pay raises and job security because of the emotions of desire and fear, not really questioning where those emotion-driven thoughts are leading them.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>“What intensifies fear and desire is ignorance. That is why rich people with lots of money often have more fear the richer they get.&quot;</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>A human’s life is a struggle between ignorance and illumination.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Once a person stops searching for information and self-knowledge, ignorance sets in.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>You go to school to learn a skill or profession to become a contributing member of society.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>To spend your life living in fear, never exploring your dreams, is cruel. To work hard for money, thinking that it will buy you things that will make you happy is also cruel. To wake up in the middle of the night terrified about paying bills is a horrible way to live. To live a life dictated by the size of a paycheck is not really living a life. Thinking that a job makes you secure is lying to yourself. That’s cruel, and that’s the trap I want you to avoid.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>It is ignorance about money that causes so much greed and fear,”</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>We only memorize historical dates and names, not the lesson.”</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>“Aren’t prices supposed to go up?” I asked. “In an educated society with a well-run government, prices should actually come down.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Confronting fear, weaknesses, and neediness by choosing our own thoughts is the way out.”</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Business generated money for us, even when we weren’t physically there.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>You want to be rich, you need to be financially literate.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Most people, in their drive to get rich, are trying to build an Empire State Building on a six-inch slab.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Illustrate the flaw in believing that money will solve all problems.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Professional success is no longer solely linked to academic success, as it once was.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>All too often, the poor and middle class allow the power of money to control them.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>They do things because everybody else does them. They conform, rather than question.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The fear of public speaking is caused by the fear of ostracism, the fear of standing out, the fear of criticism, the fear of ridicule, and the fear of being an outcast.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>When we were told to follow set procedures and not deviate from the rules, we could see how school discouraged creativity.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Money has a way of making every decision emotional.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The problem with simply working harder is that each of these three levels takes a greater share of your increased efforts.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Start minding your own business. Keep your daytime job, but start buying real assets, not liabilities or personal effects that have no real value once you get them home.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>For young people who have not yet left home, it is important for parents to teach them the difference between an asset and a liability.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>I see so many young couples who get married and trap themselves into a lifestyle that will not let them get out of debt for most of their working years.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>When I say mind your own business, I mean to build and keep your asset column strong.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>An important distinction is that rich people buy luxuries last, while the poor and middle class tend to buy luxuries first.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Buying a luxury on credit often causes a person to eventually resent that luxury because the debt becomes a financial burden.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>It took approximately 50 years in both England and the United States to sell the idea of a regular income tax.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The idea of taxes was made popular, and accepted by the majority, by telling the poor and the middle class that taxes were created only to punish the rich. This is how the masses voted for the law, and it became constitutionally legal.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>When you study the history of taxes, an interesting perspective emerges. The passage of taxes was only possible because the masses believed in the Robin Hood theory of economics: Take from the rich, and give to everyone else. The problem was that the government&#39;s appetite for money was so great that taxes soon needed to be levied on the middle class, and from there it kept trickling down.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>It seemed to me that the socialists ultimately penalized themselves due to their lack of financial education.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>No matter what the &quot;take-from-the-rich&quot; crowd came up with, the rich always found a way to outsmart them. This is how taxes were eventually levied on the middle class. The rich outsmarted the intellectuals solely because they understood the power of money, a subject not taught in schools.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>A corporation is merely a file folder with some legal documents in it, sitting in some attorney’s office and registered with a state government agency. It’s not a big building or a factory or a group of people. A corporation is merely a legal document that creates a legal body without a soul.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The income-tax rate of a corporation is less than the individual income-tax rates.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>In addition, certain expenses could be paid by a corporation with pre-tax dollars.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>They use their resources to effect change.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Knowledge is power.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>With money comes great power that requires the right knowledge to keep it and make it multiply. Without that knowledge, the world pushes you around.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>If you work for money, you give the power to you employer. If money works for you, you keep the power and control it.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>A corporation can do many things that an employee cannot, like pay expenses before paying taxes.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>For example, by owning your own corporation, your vacations can be board meetings in Hawaii. Car payments, insurance, repairs, and health-club memberships are company expenses. Most restaurant meals are partial expenses, and on and on. But it’s done legally with pre-tax dollars.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The rich hide much of their wealth using vehicles such as corporations and trusts to protect their assets from creditors.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>You own any kind of legitimate assets, I would consider finding out more about the benefits and protection offered by a corporation as soon as possible.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Learn about the protection that legal entities can provide for businesses and assets.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>We all have tremendous potential, and we all are blessed with gifts. Yet the one thing that holds all of us back is some degree of self-doubt.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Often in the real world, it’s not the smart who get ahead, but the bold.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Games reflect behavior. They are instant feedback systems.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The single most powerful asset we all have is our mind. If it is trained well, it can create enormous wealth seemingly instantaneously.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The era where humans work purely with their minds and not with their bodies.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>I’d rather welcome change than cling to the past.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>In school we learn that mistakes are bad, and we are punished for making them. Yet if you look at the way humans are designed to learn, we learn by making mistakes.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>I still have scars on my knees, but today I can ride a bike without thinking.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Failure is part of the process of success.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>People who avoid failure also avoid success.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The world is filled with smart, talented, educated, and gifted people. We meet them every day. They are all around us.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>“They are one skill away from great wealth.”</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Financial intelligence is a synergy of accounting, investing, marketing, and</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Financial intelligence is a synergy</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Financial intelligence is a synergy of accounting, investing, marketing, and law.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Schools reward people who study more and more about less and less.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>He often admitted that schools reward people who study more and more about less and less.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Pick up jargon and a sense of what is important and what is not.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Rich dad thought it best to go broke before 30. “You still have time to recover” was his advice.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>“Workers work hard enough to not be fired, and owners pay just enough so that workers won’t quit.”</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Seek work for what they will learn, more than what they will earn.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>“Where is this daily activity taking you?”</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>multilevel marketing,</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Education is more valuable than money, in the long run.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Unless a person is used to changing, it’s hard to change.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The reason so many talented people are poor is because they focus on building a better hamburger and know little to nothing about business systems.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The more specialized you become, the more you are trapped and dependent on that specialty.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Move from department to department to learn all the aspects of business systems.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Gain an overall knowledge of the operations of the business and how the various departments interrelate.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The main management skills needed for success are:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1. Management of cash flow</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>2. Management of systems</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>3. Management of people</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Communication skills such as writing, speaking, and negotiating are crucial to a life of success.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>I know of no other skills to be more important than selling and marketing.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>I have friends who are geniuses, but they cannot communicate effectively with other human beings and, as a result, their earnings are pitiful.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>“Everyone wants to go to heaven, but no one wants to die.”</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>It’s called buyer’s remorse.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>“Cynics criticize, and winners analyze”</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Analysis allowed winners to see that critics were blind, and to see opportunities that everyone else missed. And finding what people miss is key to any success.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>“I-don’t-wants hold the key to your success.”</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>They’re busy, and they stay busy as a way of avoiding something they do not want to face.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The words “I can’t afford it” shut down your brain. “How can I afford it?” opens up possibilities, excitement, and dreams.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Without that little greed, the desire to have something better, progress is not made</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>So whenever you find yourself avoiding something you know you should be doing, then the only thing to ask yourself is, “What’s in it for me?” Be a little greedy. It’s the best cure for laziness. Too much greed, however, as anything in excess can be, is not good.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>I think Eleanor Roosevelt said it best: “Do what you feel in your heart to be right—for you’ll be criticized anyway. You’ll be damned if you do, and damned if you don’t.”</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Our lives are a reflection of our habits more than our education.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>“What I know makes me money. What I don’t know loses me money. Every time I have been arrogant, I have lost money. Because when I’m arrogant, I truly believe that what I don’t know is not important,”</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Many people use arrogance to try to hide their own ignorance.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>When you know you are ignorant in a subject, start educating yourself by finding an expert in the field or a book on the subject.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Invest first in education. In reality, the only real asset you have is your mind, the most powerful tool we have dominion over.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>I took a weekend class called &quot;How to Buy Real Estate Foreclosures.&quot; I learned a formula. The next trick was to have the discipline to actually put into action what I had learned. That is where most people stop.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>In today’s fast-changing world, it’s not so much what you know anymore that counts, because often what you know is old. It is how fast you learn.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Working hard for money is an old formula born in the day of cavemen.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>It is the lack of self-discipline that causes people who get a raise to immediately go out and buy a new car or take a cruise.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Personal self-discipline is the number-one delineating factor between the rich, the poor, and the middle class.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>People who lack internal fortitude often become victims of those who have self-discipline.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The three most important management skills necessary to start your own business are management of:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1. Cash flow</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>2. People</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>3. Personal time</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Financial literacy allows one to read numbers, and numbers tell the story.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>If you’re not tough inside, the world will always push you around anyway.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Although the process of developing cash flow from an asset column is easy in theory, what’s hard is the mental fortitude to direct money to the correct use.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>With weak mental fortitude, that money flows into the paths of least resistance.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The earlier you can train yourself and those you love to be masters of money, the better.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Teach and you shall receive: the power of giving.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Whenever you feel short or in need of something, give what you want first and it will come back in buckets.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>I want sales, so I help someone else sell something, and sales come to me. I want contacts, and I help someone else get contacts.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>“God does not need to receive, but humans need to give.”</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>“Poor people are more greedy than rich people.”</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>When it comes to money, love, happiness, sales, and contacts, all one needs to remember is to give first.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>It is true that your world is only a mirror of you.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>“Teach, and you shall receive.” I have found that the more I teach those who want to learn, the more I learn.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>A torrent of new ideas and finer distinctions will come in.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>There are times when I have given and nothing has come back, or what I have received is not what I wanted. But upon closer inspection and soul searching, I was often giving to receive in those instances, instead of giving for the joy that giving itself brings.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>There are powers in this world that are much smarter than we are.
